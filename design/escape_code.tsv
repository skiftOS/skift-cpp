CSI n A	CUU	Cursor Up	Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction. If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.
CSI n B	CUD	Cursor Down
CSI n C	CUF	Cursor Forward
CSI n D	CUB	Cursor Back
CSI n E	CNL	Cursor Next Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines down. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n F	CPL	Cursor Previous Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n G	CHA	Cursor Horizontal Absolute	Moves the cursor to column n (default 1). (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n ; m H	CUP	Cursor Position	Moves the cursor to row n, column m. The values are 1-based, and default to 1 (top left corner) if omitted. A sequence such as CSI ;5H is a synonym for CSI 1;5H as well as CSI 17;H is the same as CSI 17H and CSI 17;1H
CSI n J	ED	Erase in Display	Clears part of the screen. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to end of screen. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the screen. If n is 2, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS). If n is 3, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for xterm and is supported by other terminal applications).
CSI n K	EL	Erase in Line	Erases part of the line. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is 2, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change.
CSI n S	SU	Scroll Up	Scroll whole page up by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the bottom. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n T	SD	Scroll Down	Scroll whole page down by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the top. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n ; m f	HVP	Horizontal Vertical Position	Same as CUP
CSI n m	SGR	Select Graphic Rendition	Sets the appearance of the following characters, see SGR parameters below.
CSI 5i		AUX Port On	Enable aux serial port usually for local serial printer
CSI 4i		AUX Port Off	Disable aux serial port usually for local serial printer
CSI 6n	DSR	Device Status Report	Reports the cursor position (CPR) to the application as (as though typed at the keyboard) ESC[n;mR, where n is the row and m is the column.)
CSI s	SCP	Save Cursor Position	Saves the cursor position/state.
